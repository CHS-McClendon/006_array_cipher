Grade Checkpoint #1: encoding

1. JOP -- use the JOP's we already know
2. executable jar
3. JOP - ask do you want to encode, decode, crack, or exit (E/D/C/E)?
-- branch, right now we only have encode
4. for encoding - ask for the plain text msg - another JOP
5. ask for the key - another JOP
6. display the encoded msg - another JOP
7. loop - JOP ask "Do you want to encode another msg (Y/N)" (trap errors)
either go again, or a graceful exit - another JOP



Grade Checkpoint #2: decoding

(NTFS) - use drop-down JOP's here)




Grade Checkpoint #3: cracking (don't know the key)
