Grade Checkpoint #1: encoding

1. JOP -- use the JOP's we already know, plus the new drop-down - No Scanner, no syso
2. executable jar
3. JOP drop-down class example - ask do you want to encode, decode, crack, or exit ?
-- use a switch-case (class example) branch, right now we only have encode
4. for encoding - ask for the plain text msg - another JOP (no Scanner, no syso)
5. ask for the key - another JOP
6. display the encoded msg - another JOP
7. loop - back to the first drop-down JOP
either go again, or a graceful exit - another JOP
